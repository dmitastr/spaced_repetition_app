# Spaced repetition app

Spaced repetition is a method of reviewing material at systematic intervals. At the beginning of the learning process, the intervals are spaced closely together (for example, one hour; four hours; one day). As the material is reviewed, the intervals become systematically longer (four days; one week; two weeks).

## Features

- create projects (e.g. business english) and add a list of topics you want to repeat (e.g. certain words of even subjects)
 
- app automatically will move topic to the next box if you tap that you remember it; otherwise it will be first in the list
